## It's Year 26 and We Want to Display Your Logo

The Perl and Raku Conference (now in its 26th year) would not exist without
sponsors. Above, you'll see a screen shot from Curtis Poe's [Perl’s new
object-oriented syntax is coming, but what’s
next?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT0S-jfO1mE) talk at last year's
conference in Toronto. You may be wondering how you can add your organization's
logo to this year's list. In the spirit of transparency, we are making our
sponsorship prospectus public. Please share this article freely with friends,
colleagues and decision makers so that we can reach as many new sponsors as
possible.

## The Perl and Raku Conference 2024 Prospectus

This year the [Perl and Raku Conference](https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/) will
be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 24-28, 2024. Conferences such as this
provide tangible benefits to organizations which use Perl. Aside from the
transfer of knowledge which attendees bring back to their place of work,
on-site hackathons also contribute to the growth and maintenance of the
software stack which so many companies have come to rely on. In 2022, for
example, the hackathon focused on modernizing and improving support for Perl
across various editors, allowing Perl developers to be even more productive
than they have been in the past.

There are still opportunities to support this important, grassroots Open Source
Software event. Events like these largely depend on sponsors in order to
thrive.

This year, we are looking for corporate donations to offset the costs of
feeding conference attendees. Each of these sponsorship opportunities comes
with the following:

* your logo, should you provide one, will appear on the banners which are
  displayed behind speakers and will subsequently appear in speaker videos
* your logo, a short blurb and a long blurb about your company will appear on
  the event website
* you will be listed as a sponsor in the materials handed out at the event
* we will thank you publicly at the event
* if you are able to provide some swag, we will gladly distribute it at the
  conference via our swag bags
