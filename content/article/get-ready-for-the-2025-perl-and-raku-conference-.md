The Perl and Raku Conference 2025 is coming up June 27-29, 2025, and it’s set to be an exciting gathering for developers, enthusiasts, and community members alike. This annual event brings together some of the best minds in the world of Perl and Raku programming, and we can’t wait to see you there! For the first time ever, the conference will be presented in the Palmetto State, South Carolina! The technical and cultural hub of upstate South Carolina is the city of Greenville, home of the Lockheed-Martin F-16!

Whether you’re a seasoned Perl programmer or someone eager to learn more about Raku, the conference offers the perfect opportunity to share knowledge, network with like-minded individuals, and collaborate on innovative ideas. This year’s event promises to be an immersive experience full of workshops, discussions, and talks on the latest trends and developments in the Perl and Raku ecosystems.

This year's conference format is a little different from past years, in a more-streamlined format.  On Friday, June 27, we'll have a day-long add-on class session, then the main conference on Saturday and Sunday, June 28 and 29.  Lightning talks are scheduled both days, an we have an exciting keynote from a new voice to our community on Saturday morning: [David Both](https://both.org), a writer, speaker, trainer, and long-time proponent of the Linux Philosophy.
