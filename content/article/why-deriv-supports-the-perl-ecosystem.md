As an online trading company processing millions of transactions daily, we
recognise technologies that stand the test of time. For 25 years, Perl has been
integral to our operations, and we remain committed to the ecosystem that
helped shape our technical foundation.

## Architecture Built for Scale

From our 1999 launch, Perl's unmatched text processing and CPAN's modular
approach enabled us to evolve into a global platform. Core systems handling
complex financial workflows leverage Perl's stability, with key components
still running the same battle-tested code developed in our early years.

## Engineering Milestones

Here are some of the activities we've done with Perl:

* Engineered microservices using [Myriad's](https://metacpan.org/pod/Myriad) framework
* Created real-time trading systems with Net::Async
* Published open-source integrations for Postgres and Redis
* Developed proprietary market analysis tools still in daily use

These implementations demonstrate Perl's capacity to support robust, long-term
solutions in demanding technical environments.

## Investing in Shared Infrastructure

Our support of [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/) stems from a clear conviction:
foundational tools deserve sustained backing. While our new projects explore
different technical approaches, we actively maintain:

* Support for [MetaCPAN's](https://metacpan.org/) essential developer resources
* Participation in community-driven knowledge sharing
* Commitment to [CPAN's](https://www.cpan.org/) maintenance standards

"Great technologies create lasting value," says Chris Horn, Head of
Engineering. "Our support for Perl's ecosystem honours its foundational role in
our growth while helping sustain resources that benefit developers worldwide."

## Our Open Source Commitment

Backing Perl's ecosystem reflects Deriv's long-standing belief in collaborative
development. We're proud to continue our MetaCPAN sponsorship through 2025 and
support the Perl community as part of our ongoing commitment to open-source.
