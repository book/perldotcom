As part of year 25 of [The Perl Advent Calendar](https://perladvent.org/), Perl
luminary and co-author of O’Reilly’s “Learning Perl” Randal Schwartz will be
giving a presentation entitled "[Half My Life with
Perl](https://lu.ma/giz69577)".

The presentation takes place on Saturday, Dec 14, 2024.

Randal says:

> Having been there, at the beginning with Perl, I will recount the early days
> through the modern era (or as much as I can cover in the time provided). I’ll
> deliver first-hand experience of the creation of the Camel Book, the Llama
> book, and the way I invaded comp.unix.questions with Perl 2 answers so often
> that people would post “no Perl please”. Oh, and my version of the story of
> the Schwartzian Transform.

This event will be a live stream via Zoom. The stream URL will be provided via
the event page as we get closer to the date.

📹 If you can't make the live stream, don't worry — the event will be recorded
and added to this year's Perl Advent Calendar.

If you'd like to be notified about the recording, [please register for the
event](https://lu.ma/giz69577) and we'll send out a blast with the Advent
Calendar URL once it has become available.
